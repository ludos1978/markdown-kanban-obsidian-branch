# Duplicate Pattern Analysis

## Initial Findings from kanbanWebviewPanel.ts

### Pattern Counts
- **try blocks**: 39 occurrences
- **path.resolve()**: 2 occurrences (✅ mostly cleaned up with PathResolver)
- **fs.existsSync()**: 11 occurrences
- **fs.readFileSync()**: 9 occurrences
- **fs.writeFileSync()**: 0 occurrences (✅ cleaned up with FileWriter)
- **Map.get()**: 18 occurrences

## Areas to Investigate for Duplicates

### 1. Try-Catch Blocks (39 instances)
Likely have similar error handling patterns that could be abstracted.

### 2. File Existence Checks (11 instances)
Pattern: `if (fs.existsSync(path)) { ... }`
- Should check if these can use FileWriter or PathResolver

### 3. File Reading (9 instances)
Pattern: `fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8')`
- Could create a helper or use existing service

### 4. Map Operations (18 instances)
- Already improved with `_findIncludeFile()` helper
- Check if more can be consolidated

## Next Steps
1. Analyze try-catch patterns for common error handling
2. Look for similar function bodies doing the same thing
3. Check for duplicate validation logic
4. Find similar data transformation patterns
