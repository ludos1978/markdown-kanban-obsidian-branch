---

## Testing Status

### Compilation ✅
```bash
✅ TypeScript: No errors
✅ All imports: Resolved
✅ Type safety: Maintained
```

### Unit Tests ⚠️
```bash
✅ PathResolver: 30+ tests written
⏸️ Jest config: Needs fix to run
⚠️ Other services: No tests yet
```

### Integration Tests ⏸️
```bash
⏸️ Phase 3 (Save): Manual testing needed
⏸️ Phase 4 (Export): Manual testing needed
```

**Testing Checklist:** See [phase5-testing-checklist.md](phase5-testing-checklist.md)

---

## Next Steps (Phase 5)

### Immediate (Testing)
1. ⏸️ Execute testing checklist
2. ⏸️ Compare old vs new export results
3. ⏸️ Fix any issues found
4. ⏸️ Performance benchmarks

### Short-term (Migration)
5. ⏸️ Find all exportUnified() callers
6. ⏸️ Migrate to exportUnifiedV2()
7. ⏸️ Test each migration
8. ⏸️ Verify no regressions

### Long-term (Cleanup)
9. ⏸️ Deprecate old export methods
10. ⏸️ Remove deprecated code (~750 lines)
11. ⏸️ Final documentation
12. ⏸️ Merge to main

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours
**Risk Level:** Low (gradual migration)

2. Test Phase 3 changes (save operations)
3. Test Phase 4 changes (export operations)
4. Document results
5. Fix any issues found
```

### Option 2: Migration
```bash
# Find callers and migrate
1. Search for exportUnified() calls
2. Update to exportUnifiedV2()
3. Test each caller
4. Verify functionality
```

### Option 3: Review
```bash
# Review implementation
1. Read service code
2. Review documentation
3. Suggest improvements
4. Plan optimizations
```

### Option 4: Merge Preparation

## Quick Reference

**Branch:** `unified-export`
**Commits:** 5 (all phases + docs)
**Services:** 7 new files in src/services/
**Tests:** 1 file (PathResolver.test.ts)
**Docs:** 10 files in tmp/
**Status:** Ready for Phase 5 testing

---

## Decision Points

### Before Phase 5
- [ ] Should we run automated tests first?
- [ ] Should we fix Jest configuration?
- [ ] Should we do manual testing?
- [ ] How thorough should testing be?

### During Phase 5
- [ ] Migrate all callers at once or gradually?
- [ ] How long to keep old code deprecated?
- [ ] Should we keep old code as fallback?

### After Phase 5
- [ ] When to merge to main?
- [ ] How to communicate changes to users?
- [ ] Should we create release notes?

---

**🎯 Current State:** Implementation complete, ready for testing

**🎯 Next Milestone:** Complete Phase 5 testing checklist

**🎯 Final Goal:** Merge unified architecture to main branch
