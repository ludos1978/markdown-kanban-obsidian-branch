## Detailed Analysis

### Group 1: Single Item Save

#### `saveColumnIncludeChanges(column: KanbanColumn)`
**Purpose**: Save one column's tasks back to its presentation include file

**Logic**:
1. Validate column has include mode
2. Get include file path
3. **Complex validation**: Check if tasks match baseline (30% overlap threshold)
4. Convert column tasks to presentation format
5. Compare with current file content
6. Write if different
7. Update unified tracking

**Special feature**: Sophisticated overlap detection to prevent saving wrong data

#### `saveTaskIncludeChanges(task: KanbanTask)`
**Purpose**: Save one task's content back to its task include file

**Logic**:
1. Validate task has include mode
2. Get include file path
3. Create directory if needed
4. Reconstruct file content from task (title + description)
5. Compare with current file
6. Create backup
7. Write if different
8. Update unified tracking

**Special feature**: Creates directories, simpler content format

### Group 2: Bulk Save

#### `saveAllColumnIncludeChanges()`
**Purpose**: Save all columns that have unsaved include files

**Logic**:
1. Filter columns with include mode
2. Filter out recently reloaded files (prevent loop)
3. Call `saveColumnIncludeChanges()` for each

**Delegation**: Just calls single-item save function

#### `saveAllTaskIncludeChanges()`
**Purpose**: Save all tasks that have unsaved include files

**Logic**:
1. Iterate all columns and tasks
2. Filter tasks with include mode
3. Filter out recently reloaded files
4. Call `saveTaskIncludeChanges()` for each

**Delegation**: Just calls single-item save function

### Group 3: Generic Save

#### `saveIncludeFileChanges(filePath: string)`
**Purpose**: Save include file changes by file path (not by column/task)

**Logic**:
1. Find which column uses this file path
2. Call `saveColumnIncludeChanges()` for that column
3. Or find which task uses this file path
4. Call `saveTaskIncludeChanges()` for that task

**Delegation**: Dispatcher that calls column or task save

#### `saveIncludeFileAsBackup(filePath: string)`
**Purpose**: Create backup of include file with current kanban changes

**Logic**:
1. Find column or task using this file
2. Generate presentation content from column/task
3. Create backup file with timestamp
4. Don't update the actual file

**Special feature**: Backup creation, not actual save

## Can They Be Consolidated?

### Analysis

**NO - They are fundamentally different:**

1. **Different data structures**:
   - Column: Multiple tasks → presentation format
   - Task: Single task → simple text format
   - Different parsers (PresentationParser vs simple text)

2. **Different validation**:
   - Column: Complex overlap detection (prevent wrong data)
   - Task: Simple content comparison
   - Column: Checks baseline match
   - Task: No baseline check needed

3. **Different creation logic**:
   - Column: Files must exist (won't create)
   - Task: Creates directories + files if needed

4. **Different purposes**:
   - Column includes: External presentation files merged into kanban
   - Task includes: Simple text snippets included in tasks
   - File format is completely different!

### Shared Code (could extract)

Both functions share these patterns:
- Get document and base path
- Resolve absolute path with `PathResolver.resolve()`
- Check file exists with `fs.existsSync()`
- Read current content with `fs.readFileSync()`
- Compare content before writing
- Update unified tracking after write
- Use `FileWriter.writeFile()` for actual write

**Possible helper**:
```typescript
private async _saveIncludeFileWithChecks(
    absolutePath: string,
    newContent: string,
    relativePath: string,
    options: { createBackup?: boolean; validateBaseline?: (baseline: string) => boolean }
): Promise<boolean> {
    // Common pattern for:
    // - Check existence
    // - Read current
    // - Compare content
    // - Create backup
    // - Write
    // - Update tracking
}
```

**But**: Still need separate functions for:
- Generating content (presentation vs simple text)
- Validation logic (overlap vs simple)
- Directory creation (task vs column)

## Conclusion

**These functions LOOK similar but are fundamentally different.**

Consolidation would:
- ❌ Create complex abstraction with many conditionals
- ❌ Mix two different file formats (presentation vs text)
- ❌ Make code harder to understand
- ❌ Risk breaking the delicate overlap detection
- ✅ Save maybe 20-30 lines of boilerplate
- ✅ But add 40+ lines of abstraction

**Recommendation**: **Leave them separate**

The shared patterns are simple enough that duplication is better than premature abstraction. The 4-6 lines of shared code (get path, check exists, read, compare) is not worth abstracting when the core logic (content generation, validation) is completely different.

## Summary of All Cleanup Analyses

### 1. ✅ Configuration Getters - COMPLETED
- **Result**: Removed 13 useless wrappers, saved 81 lines
- **Worth it**: Yes! High value, low risk

### 2. ❌ File I/O Operations - SKIP
- **Result**: Not much duplication, different contexts (sync/async)
- **Worth it**: No - low value, mixed contexts

### 3. ❌ Save Functions - SKIP
- **Result**: Look similar but fundamentally different
- **Worth it**: No - abstraction would be worse than duplication

## Next Cleanup Targets?

From the cleanup analyzer, better opportunities:

1. **Unused functions**: 14 high-priority + 277 medium-priority
   - Could save ~2,500 lines
   - Need careful testing

2. **Try-catch patterns** (39 instances)
   - But each might have specific error handling
   - Need analysis per-block

3. **Look for other simple wrappers** like config getters
   - Quick wins with low risk

**Your decision**: What should we tackle next?
- A) Analyze and remove unused functions?
- B) Look for more simple wrapper functions?
- C) Something else?
- D) Call it done for now and test what we have?
