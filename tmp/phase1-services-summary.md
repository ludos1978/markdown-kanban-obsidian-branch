# Phase 1: Core Services - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully completed Phase 1 of the unified save/backup/export architecture refactoring. Created three core service utilities that consolidate duplicate code across the codebase.

## Services Created

### 1. PathResolver Service
**File:** [src/services/PathResolver.ts](../src/services/PathResolver.ts)

**Purpose:** Consolidates all path handling logic from 6+ locations in the codebase.

**Key Methods:**
- `resolve()` - Handles relative→absolute path resolution with URL decoding
- `normalize()` - Adds `./` prefix consistently
- `removePrefix()` - Removes `./` prefix
- `areEqual()` - Compares paths handling prefix variations
- `findMatch()` - Finds paths in arrays
- `getVariations()` - Generates all equivalent path formats
- Plus utilities: `getRelativePath`, `isAbsolute`, `getBaseName`, `getDirName`, `join`, `normalizeSeparators`

**Replaces duplicate code in:**
- kanbanWebviewPanel.ts (lines 2659, 2671, 2950, etc.)
- exportService.ts (line 424)
- markdownParser.ts (lines 164, 298)

**Test Coverage:** 30+ unit tests in [src/test/unit/PathResolver.test.ts](../src/test/unit/PathResolver.test.ts)

### 2. FileWriter Service
**File:** [src/services/FileWriter.ts](../src/services/FileWriter.ts)

**Purpose:** Unifies all file write operations from 8+ locations across the codebase.

**Key Methods:**
- `writeFile()` - Write content to file with proper error handling
- `writeBatch()` - Write multiple files efficiently
- `createBackup()` - Create timestamped backup before writing
- `fileExists()` - Check if file exists
- `directoryExists()` - Check if directory exists
- `getUniqueFilePath()` - Generate unique filename if file exists
- `deleteFile()` - Safely delete file (uses trash if possible)
- `readFile()` - Read file content wrapper
- `ensureDirectory()` - Create directory if it doesn't exist

**Replaces duplicate code in:**
- exportService.ts: Multiple `writeFileSync` calls
- kanbanWebviewPanel.ts: Save operations
- backupService.ts: Backup file writing
- Plus 5+ other inline file operations

**Features:**
- Automatic directory creation
- Optional backup before overwrite
- Batch write operations with summary notifications
- VSCode notifications for user feedback
- Safe delete with trash support

### 3. FormatConverter Service
**File:** [src/services/FormatConverter.ts](../src/services/FormatConverter.ts)

**Purpose:** Consolidates all format conversion logic from 8+ duplicate functions.

**Key Methods:**
- `kanbanToPresentation()` - Convert kanban format to presentation slides
- `presentationToKanban()` - Convert presentation slides to kanban format
- `taskToPresentation()` - Convert single task to slide
- `columnToMarkdown()` - Convert column to markdown
- `taskToMarkdown()` - Convert task to markdown
- `detectFormat()` - Auto-detect content format (kanban/presentation/unknown)
- `convert()` - Auto-convert between formats
- `stripYaml()` - Remove YAML frontmatter
- `extractYaml()` - Extract YAML frontmatter
- `addYaml()` - Add/replace YAML frontmatter

**Replaces duplicate code in:**
- exportService.ts: `convertToPresentationFormat`, `convertPresentationToKanban`
- presentationParser.ts: `parsePresentation`, `slidesToTasks`, `tasksToPresentation`
- markdownParser.ts: `parseKanban`, `columnsToMarkdown`
- kanbanWebviewPanel.ts: Various inline conversions

**Features:**
- Auto-detection of source format
- YAML frontmatter preservation
- Bidirectional conversion (kanban ↔ presentation)
- Column and task level conversion
- Metadata preservation

## Validation Status

All three services successfully compile with TypeScript:

```bash
✅ PathResolver.ts - Compiles successfully
✅ FileWriter.ts - Compiles successfully
✅ FormatConverter.ts - Compiles successfully
```

PathResolver has comprehensive unit test coverage (30+ tests) ready to run once test infrastructure is updated.

## Impact Analysis

### Code Reduction (Estimated)
- **PathResolver**: Eliminates ~150 lines of duplicate path logic
- **FileWriter**: Eliminates ~250 lines of duplicate file operations
- **FormatConverter**: Eliminates ~400 lines of duplicate conversion logic

**Total estimated reduction in Phase 1 alone: ~800 lines of duplicate code**

### Code Quality Improvements
- ✅ Centralized logic - single source of truth
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Consistent behavior across codebase
- ✅ Better testability
- ✅ Easier maintenance
- ✅ Type safety with TypeScript

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

According to the [unified architecture plan](unified-save-export-architecture-plan.md):

1. **Create ContentPipelineService**
   - Unified pipeline for save/backup/export operations
   - Uses PathResolver, FileWriter, and FormatConverter

2. **Create IncludeProcessor**
   - Handle all include types (include, columninclude, taskinclude)
   - Merge vs separate file logic

3. **Create AssetHandler**
   - Image and media file handling during export
   - Path resolution for assets

4. **Create OperationOptions**
   - Unified options system for all operations
   - Format strategy, scope, include mode, etc.

---

## Notes

- PathResolver tests are written but need Jest TypeScript support to run
- All services follow KISS principle as per project guidelines
- Services are stateless utility classes (no instances needed)
- Each service has comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Services compile without errors using TypeScript strict mode

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Phase:** 1 of 5 (Core Services)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
